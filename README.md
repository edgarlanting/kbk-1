## Summary

Kubernetes Bundle toolKit (KBK) is a simple command-line tool for parsing files contained within Kubernetes diagnostic bundles.

The intent of `kbk` is to mimic the functionality of the `kubectl` CLI command when working with Kubernetes diagnostic bundles and parse their contents more effective and efficiently. To accomplish this, we leverage the use of `yq`. Using `kbk` allows you to quickly gather information about a cluster and its state without having to open large, and often cumbersome, YAML, JSON, and log files.

This project is a work-in-progress and will likely be updated regularly. Any feedback or contributions are welcome.

## Installation

Users have multiple options for running `kbk`, including running locally or within a Docker container.

### Installing and Running Locally

As `kbk` leverages `yq`, and thus `jq`, both are required for using `kbk`.

On MacOS, these can be installed with `brew`:

```sh
brew install jq python-yq
```

On RedHat based distros:

```sh
yum install -y jq
pip install yq
```

On Debian based distros:

```sh
apt install -y jq
pip install yq
```

Once `jq` and `yq` are installed, simply add `kbk` to your `PATH`.

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/some-things/kbk/master/kbk.sh
sudo mv kbk.sh /usr/local/bin/kbk
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kbk
kbk --help
```

### Running via Docker

To run `kbk` against a bundle using Docker, execute the following commands while the bundle root is your working directory:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/bundle-root -w="/bundle-root" dnemes/kbk:latest
kbk --help
```

## Environment Variables

`kbk` supports the following environment variables:

|Variable|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|
|KBK_TICKETS_DIR|${HOME}/Documents/logs/tickets|Directory where the bundle will be extracted|
|KBK_BUNDLE_DIR|Folder prefixed with 'bundle-' in /path/to/work/dir|Directoy for bundle root|

## Usage

Note: `kbk` relies on the bundle root directory name being prefixed with `bundle-` (however, it can be from any sub-directory). This is only a factor when running locally. To automatically extract a bundle and its contents to a directory name prefixed with `bundle-`, please see [`kbk extract`](#extract).

### Interacting with Kubernetes Resources

#### `api-resources`

Display a list of api-resources contained in the diagnostic bundle.

```sh
kbk api-resources
```

```sh
$ kbk api-resources
addons
alertmanagers
apiservices
authcodes
authrequests
backups
backupstoragelocations
bgpconfigurations
bgppeers
blockaffinities
certificatesigningrequests
clusterinformations
clusterrolebindings
clusterroles
componentstatuses
configmaps
...
```

#### `explain`

Print metadata about specific resource types. This is useful for learning about the resource.

```sh
kbk explain <resource-kind>
```

```sh
$ kbk explain service
KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Service is a named abstraction of software service (for example, mysql)
     consisting of local port (for example 3306) that the proxy listens on, and
     the selector that determines which pods will answer requests sent through
     the proxy.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion <string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources

   kind <string>
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

   metadata <Object>
     Standard object's metadata. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata

   spec <Object>
     Spec defines the behavior of a service.
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

   status <Object>
     Most recently observed status of the service. Populated by the system.
     Read-only. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status
```

#### `get`

Reads resources from the cluster and formats them as output.

```sh
kbk get <resource-kind>
```

```sh
$ kbk get nodes

### Miscellaneous

#### `extract`

Extracts a compressed bundle to a directory. By default, bundles will be extracted to `$HOME/Documents/logs/tickets/<specified-name>`. To change this, you can modify `USER_TICKETS_DIR`.

```sh
kbk extract <bundle-name>.tar.gz
```

```sh
$ kbk extract 20190815T002039.tar.gz
Ticket number: 12345
Extracting bundle to /Users/dn/Documents/logs/tickets/12345/bundle-20190815T002039...
Extracting nodes...
Finished extracting bundle to /Users/dn/Documents/logs/tickets/12345/bundle-20190815T002039
```

## Troubleshooting with `kbk`

A good place to start when troubleshooting is running `kbk checks`. This will check into the following conditions:

- Pods with containers not in a ready state
- Nodes not in a ready state
- Nodes with an unsupported host OS
- Nodes with an unsupported host kernel
- Nodes with disk usage exceeding 90% for a particular mount
- Nodes with swap enabled
- Nodes without containerd service in a running state
- Nodes without kubelet service in a running state
- Nodes with AppArmor enabled
- Nodes with processes oom-killed
- Nodes encountering a known kmem leak bug

Another good resource is `kbk get events`, which will provide a high level overview of the events in the cluster. Kubernetes events are a resource type in Kubernetes that are automatically created when other resources have state changes, errors, or other messages that should be broadcast to the system.

Given the issue you are observing, you may want to focus on either the cluster (and its underlying infrastructure) or application itself. Note that most troubleshooting methods using `kubectl` will also apply to `kbk`, other than those requiring a live cluster.

### Clusters

The first thing to debug in your cluster is if your nodes are all registered correctly.

```sh
kbk get nodes
```

And verify that all of the nodes you expect to see are present and that they are all in the `Ready` state.

You may also want to view the logs associated with Kubernetes components. Note that you can use `kbk cluster leaders` and `kbk get pods` to assist in identifying leaders and pod names.

Master only:

|Component|Log Location|Description|
|---|---|---|
|kube-apiserver|`kbk logs <kube-apiserver-pod-name>`|API Server, responsible for serving the API|
|kube-scheduler|`kbk logs <kube-scheduler-leader-pod-name>`|Scheduler, responsible for making scheduling decisions|
|kube-controller-manager|`kbk logs <kube-controller-manager-leader-pod-name>`|Controller that manages replication controllers|

All nodes:

|Component|Log Location|Description|
|---|---|---|
|kubelet|`less <node-ip>/kubelet.service.log`|Kubelet, responsible for running containers on the node|
|kube-proxy|`kbk logs <kube-proxy-pod-name>`|Kube Proxy, responsible for service load balancing|

#### Specific scenarios

- `kube-apiserver` crashing or host is offline
  - Unable to stop, update, or start new pods, services, replication controller
  - Existing pods and services should continue to work normally, unless they depend on the Kubernetes API
- `kube-apiserver` backing storage lost
  - `kube-apiserver` should fail to come up
  - Kubelets will not be able to reach it but will continue to run the same pods and provide the same service proxying
  - Manual recovery or recreation of apiserver state necessary before apiserver is restarted
- Supporting services (node controller, replication controller manager, scheduler, etc.) shutdown or crashing
  - Currently these are colocated with the apiserver and their unavailability has similar consequences to that of the apiserver.
- Individual node shutdown
  - Pods on that node stop running
- Network partition
  - Partition A thinks the nodes in partition B are down; partition B thinks the apiserver is down. (Assuming the master node ends up in partition A)
- Kubelet software fault
  - Crashing kubelet cannot start new pods on the node
  - Kubelet might delete pods
  - Node marked unhealthy
  - Replication controllers start new pods elsewhere

### Applications

The first step in troubleshooting is triage. What is the problem? Is it your Pods, your Replication Controller or your Service?

#### Debugging Pods

The first step in debugging a Pod is taking a look at it. Check the current state of the Pod and recent events with the following command:

```sh
kbk describe pod <pod-name>
```

Look at the state of the containers in the pod. Are they all `Running`? Have there been recent restarts? What do the events tell you?

##### My pod stays pending

If a Pod is stuck in `Pending` it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node. Generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling. Look at the output of the `kbk describe ...` command above. There should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod. Reasons include:

- You don’t have enough resources: You may have exhausted the supply of CPU or Memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete Pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
- You are using hostPort: When you bind a Pod to a hostPort there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled. In most cases, hostPort is unnecessary, try using a Service object to expose your Pod. If you do require hostPort then you can only schedule as many Pods as there are nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.

##### My pod stays waiting

If a Pod is stuck in the `Waiting` state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can’t run on that machine. Again, the information from `kbk describe ...` should be informative. The most common cause of `Waiting` pods is a failure to pull the image. In that case, there are three things to check:

- Make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
- Have you pushed the image to the repository?
- Run a manual `docker pull <image>` on your machine to see if the image can be pulled.

##### My pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy

Take a look at the logs of the current container:

```sh
kbk logs <pod-name>
```

You may also want to check the Kubelet and kube-scheduler logs (See cluster troubleshooting section above).

#### Debugging Replication Controllers

Replication controllers are fairly straightforward. They can either create Pods or they can’t. If they can’t create pods, then please refer to the instructions above to debug your pods.

You can also use `kbk describe rc <controller-name> -n <namespace>` to inspect events related to the replication controller.

#### Debugging Services

Services provide load balancing across a set of pods. There are several common problems that can make Services not work properly. The following instructions should help debug Service problems.

First, verify that there are endpoints for the service. For every Service object, the apiserver makes an `endpoints` resource available.

You can view this resource with:

```sh
kbk get endpoints
```

Make sure that the endpoints match up with the number of containers that you expect to be a member of your service. For example, if your Service is for an nginx container with 3 replicas, you would expect to see three different IP addresses in the Service’s endpoints.

##### My service is missing endpoints

If you are missing endpoints, try listing pods using the labels that Service uses. Imagine that you have a Service where the labels are:

```yaml
...
spec:
  - selector:
     name: nginx
     type: frontend
```

You can then check the pods that match this selector, verifying that the list matches the Pods that you expect to provide your Service.

If the list of pods matches expectations, but your endpoints are still empty, it’s possible that you don’t have the right ports exposed. If your service has a `containerPort` specified, but the Pods that are selected don’t have that port listed, then they won’t be added to the endpoints list.

Verify that the pod’s `containerPort` matches up with the Service’s `containerPort`.

##### Network traffic is not forwarded

If you can connect to the service, but the connection is immediately dropped, and there are endpoints in the endpoints list, it’s likely that the proxy can’t contact your pods.

There are three things to check:

- Are your pods working correctly? Look for restart count, and debug pods.
- Can you connect to your pods directly? Get the IP address for the Pod, and try to connect directly to that IP.
- Is your application serving on the port that you configured? Kubernetes doesn’t do port remapping, so if your application serves on 8080, the `containerPort` field needs to be 8080.
